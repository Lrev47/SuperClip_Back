# SuperClip Backend - Development Plans

This directory contains planning documents for the SuperClip backend implementation following test-driven development principles.

Each file in this directory represents a module or component that needs to be implemented in the actual `src` directory. The markdown files serve as development guides with clear specifications, dependencies, and implementation details.

## Structure

Each file follows this standard template:

```markdown
# [Filename]

- [ ] Test file made
- [ ] File made
- [ ] File passed the tests

## Purpose
Describe what this file does and why it exists

## Dependencies
- List of modules/packages this file depends on

## Inputs/Outputs
- Describe inputs this module accepts
- Describe outputs/return values

## Data Types
```typescript
// Any TypeScript interfaces, types, or DTOs used
```

## API/Methods
- Method signatures and descriptions

## Implementation Notes
Additional details about implementation
```

## Development Workflow

1. Review the test files to understand requirements
2. Check the corresponding planning document in this directory
3. Implement the file in the `src` directory
4. Run tests to verify implementation
5. Update checkboxes in the planning document as progress is made
