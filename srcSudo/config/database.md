# database.ts

- [ ] Test file made
- [ ] File made
- [ ] File passed the tests

## Purpose
This file configures the database connection using Prisma Client. It handles connection setup, provides a singleton instance of the Prisma client, and manages connection lifecycle events.

## Dependencies
- External packages:
  - @prisma/client
  - dotenv
- Internal modules:
  - ../utils/logger

## Inputs/Outputs
- **Input**: Environment variables from .env file (DATABASE_URL)
- **Output**: Configured Prisma client instance

## Data Types
```typescript
// Singleton PrismaClient type
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';

// Configuration options type
interface DatabaseConfig {
  url: string;
  logging: boolean;
  connectionTimeout?: number;
  maxConnections?: number;
}
```

## API/Methods
### getPrismaClient
- Description: Returns a singleton instance of the PrismaClient
- Signature: `getPrismaClient(): PrismaClient`
- Returns: Instance of PrismaClient for database operations
- Throws: Error if database connection cannot be established

### connect
- Description: Explicitly connects to the database
- Signature: `connect(): Promise<void>`
- Returns: Promise that resolves when the connection is established
- Throws: Error if connection fails

### disconnect
- Description: Explicitly disconnects from the database
- Signature: `disconnect(): Promise<void>`
- Returns: Promise that resolves when the connection is closed
- Throws: Error if disconnection fails

## Test Specifications
### Unit Tests
- Should return the same Prisma instance when called multiple times
- Should throw an error when DATABASE_URL is not set
- Should handle connection errors gracefully
- Should properly parse database configuration options

### Integration Tests
- Should successfully connect to a test database
- Should execute a simple query against the database
- Should handle disconnection properly

## Implementation Notes
1. **Singleton Pattern**:
   - Use a singleton pattern for the Prisma client to prevent multiple connections
   - Initialize the client only when needed (lazy loading)

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement proper error handling for connection issues
   - Add retry logic for transient database connection failures
   - Log database errors with appropriate severity levels

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Handle process termination by cleaning up database connections
   - Implement connection pooling configuration for production
   - Add timeout handling for long-running queries
